Data Set Background 		(*taken from authors' initial description)


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
 Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
 The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
 From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Modifications:

The subjects, activities, and metric variables files were merged together for training and test data separately, and the resulting two files were appended together.
Only a subset of the metric variables dealing with mean and standard deviation (std) were kept (66 metrics). Additionally, one variable was created designated whether a subject was in the training or test groups.
In the end, the data contains 69 columns (subject number, activity name, training/test group, and the 66 metric variables).  Lastly, all metrics were averaged by subject/activity, resulting in a tidy dataset 
where each metric variable value represents the mean measurement for that group. 

The list below provides the final modified, more descriptive variable names and the initial names. 
It should be noted that all the final variables represent the mean of the variables, averaged across different subject/activity groups.
